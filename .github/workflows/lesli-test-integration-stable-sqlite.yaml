# A descriptive name for your workflow.
name: Rails CI with Engine Tests

# This workflow will run on every push to the main branch
# and for all pull requests.
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

# Define a single job to run the build and tests.

    # The runner environment for this job. Ubuntu is a common choice for Rails.
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    # The steps that will be executed in sequence.
    steps:
      # Step 1: Checks out your repository's code. This is a standard first step.
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # Step 2: Sets up a Ruby environment. We're using a stable version.
      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1
        with:
          ruby-version: '3.2' # Specify the Ruby version you need.
          bundler-cache: true # Caches gems to speed up subsequent runs.

      # Step 3: Installs the Rails gem globally.
      - name: Install Rails gem
        run: gem install rails

      # Step 4: Creates a fresh, new Rails application.
      - name: Create new Rails app
        run: rails new rails_app --skip-bundle

      # Step 5: Navigate into the new Rails application directory.
      - name: Change working directory to Rails app
        working-directory: ./rails_app
        run: ls -la

      # Step 6: Creates the 'engines' directory inside the new Rails app.
      - name: Create engines directory
        working-directory: ./rails_app
        run: mkdir -p engines

      # Step 7: Clones your external repository into the 'engines' directory.
      # **IMPORTANT:** Replace the URL below with the actual URL of your repository.
      - name: Clone external engine repository
        working-directory: ./rails_app/engines
        run: git clone https://github.com/my-user/my_repository.git

      # Step 8: Adds the cloned repository to the new Rails app's Gemfile.
      # This tells Rails to treat the cloned repo as a local gem (an engine).
      # # # - name: Add engine to Gemfile
      # # #   working-directory: ./rails_app
      # # #   run: echo "gem 'my_repository', path: 'engines/my_repository'" >> Gemfile

      # # # # Step 9: Install all the gems, including the newly added engine gem.
      # # # - name: Install dependencies
      # # #   working-directory: ./rails_app
      # # #   run: bundle install

      # # # # Step 10: Executes Minitest. This command is a powerful feature of Rails 6+
      # # # # as it automatically finds and runs all tests within the main app and
      # # # # any mounted engines, including the one we just cloned.
      # # # - name: Run Minitest
      # # #   working-directory: ./rails_app
      # # #   run: bundle exec rails test
